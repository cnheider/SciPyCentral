Prerequisites
-------------

Please ensure these Python packages are available on your server:

*   Django, http://djangoproject.com: ``easy_install -U django`

    We developed on Django 1.3.0; earlier versions may also work.

*   Pygments, http://pygments.org: ``easy_install -U pygments``

    We used version 1.4 during development; earlier versions may also work.

*   Sphinx, http://sphinx.pocoo.org: ``easy_install -U sphinx``

    We used version 1.1 during development because it handles MathJax.

    Note that the Sphinx requirement might seem to be a bit of an overkill
    for comment compiling. We use it though because it handles math nicely
    (a requirement for scientific commenting), and formats all manner of
    bullets, paragraphs, tt-text, etc. ``rst2html`` from ``docutils`` might
    be a better, lightweight substitute in the future.


Not required yet (might be as we add more functionality to the site):

*   Python Imaging Library (for screenshot handling)
*   easy_install python-openid

Installation
--------------

After Django installation and cloning this git repository on your server:

#.	``./manage.py syncdb``
#.	``./manage.py loaddata sample``
