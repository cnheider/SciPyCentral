Prerequisites
-------------

Please ensure these Python packages are available on your server:

*   Django, http://djangoproject.com: ``easy_install -U django`

    We developed on Django 1.3.0; earlier versions may also work.

*   Pygments, http://pygments.org: ``easy_install -U pygments``

    We used version 1.4 during development; earlier versions may also work.

*   Sphinx, http://sphinx.pocoo.org: ``easy_install -U sphinx``

    We used version 1.1 during development because it handles MathJax.

    Note that the Sphinx requirement might seem to be a bit of an overkill
    for comment compiling. We use it though because it handles math nicely
    (a requirement for scientific commenting), and formats all manner of
    bullets, paragraphs, tt-text, etc. ``rst2html`` from ``docutils`` might
    be a better, lightweight substitute in the future.

*   Haystack search, http://haystacksearch.org at version 1.2.0

    *   git clone https://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack.git
    *   git checkout 00a23e0cd6ac533073c2  # version 1.2.0; not 2.0.0-alpha
    *   cd django-haystack
    *   python setup.py install
    *   Edit the ``search_settings.py`` file under ``deploy`` to customize
        the search options.

    We use the Xapian backend with Haystack:

    *   See the installation instructions at
        http://docs.haystacksearch.org/dev/installing_search_engines.html

        although installation in a hosted environment will require more work.

        (We use Xapian version 1.2.6 on our dev and production servers)

    *   After installing Xapian, also install:

        *   ``git clone git://github.com/notanumber/xapian-haystack.git``
        *   Symlink the ``xapian_backend.py`` file in the above repo to
            ``haystack/backends/xapian_backend.py`` location.


Not required yet (might be as we add more functionality to the site):

*   Python Imaging Library (for screenshot handling)
*   easy_install python-openid

Installation
--------------

After Django installation and cloning this git repository on your server:

#.	``./manage.py syncdb``
#.	``./manage.py loaddata sample``  # to load licenses, tags and other data
#.  ``./manage.py rebuild_index``    # to rebuild the search index
